# My Notes

This are notes on various things I've dealt with over the years. 

Some are more recent than others. In some cases they are completely out of date as the issues/bugs they addressed do not exist anymore. 

Most of them can be classified as workarounds or fixes. Others are general guidance or notes on how to do anything. 

I do not claim that any of them are the best way of doing things. Just notes on the approaches that **worked** and the ones that did **NOT** for various things.
